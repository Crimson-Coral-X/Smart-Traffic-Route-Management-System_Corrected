```

## Run the application

The frontend is a self-contained browser application, so no Flask, Node.js or package installation is required.

### Easiest method

Open the `frontend` folder and double-click:

```text
index.html
```

It will open the complete application in your browser.

### Better VS Code method

Install the **Live Server** extension in VS Code.

1. Open the project folder.
2. Open `frontend/index.html`.
3. Right-click the file.
4. Select **Open with Live Server**.
5. The application opens in your browser.

## Test the C engine

Open a VS Code terminal:

```powershell
cd backend
gcc -std=c11 -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -O2 main.c graph.c algorithms.c -o traffic_engine.exe
```

Test Dijkstra:

```powershell
.\traffic_engine.exe route 0 5
```

Test BFS:

```powershell
.\traffic_engine.exe bfs 0
```

Test DFS:

```powershell
.\traffic_engine.exe dfs 0
```

Test Kruskal:

```powershell
.\traffic_engine.exe mst
```

Or use the Makefile if `mingw32-make` is installed:

```powershell
mingw32-make
.\traffic_engine.exe mst
```

## Important architecture note

The browser UI contains the same algorithms in JavaScript so the application can operate immediately without requiring a native process server.

The `backend/` directory contains the **academic C implementation** of the required DSA. This is the code to show during a C/DSA evaluation:

- `graph.h` — graph structs and API
- `graph.c` — dynamic adjacency list + matrix and graph mutation
- `algorithms.c` — Dijkstra, Kruskal/DSU, BFS, DFS
- `main.c` — executable test interface

For a full production deployment, the C engine can be exposed to the browser through an HTTP/WebSocket service layer. The current workspace intentionally keeps the demo dependency-free and easy to run.

## Algorithms and complexity

### Dijkstra

Uses non-negative traffic weights.

This educational implementation is:

`O(V² + E)`

### Kruskal

Sorts edges and uses Disjoint Set Union / Union-Find.

`O(E log E)`

### BFS

Queue-based graph traversal.

`O(V + E)`

### DFS

Recursive depth-first traversal.

`O(V + E)`

## Why both adjacency list and matrix?

The adjacency list is efficient when iterating through a sparse road network. The matrix gives constant-time direct access to a road weight.

Every graph mutation updates both representations.

## How to demonstrate it

1. Open Dashboard.
2. Show the city graph.
3. Go to Route Optimizer.
4. Select two intersections.
5. Run Dijkstra.
6. Show the highlighted green route.
7. Open Traffic Control.
8. Increase a road's weight.
9. Run Dijkstra again and demonstrate the route can change.
10. Open Emergency Mode and demonstrate BFS/DFS.
11. Open Infrastructure and run Kruskal.
12. Explain the C source files and data structures.

## Viva explanation

**Graph:** A city is modeled as a weighted graph. Intersections are vertices and roads are weighted edges.

**Traffic weight:** A larger weight means a slower/more expensive road. It can represent estimated travel time or congestion-adjusted cost.

**Dijkstra:** Finds the minimum-cost route between intersections.

**MST:** Finds a minimum-cost network connecting all intersections, suitable conceptually for sensors, cameras or communication cables.

**BFS:** Traverses the emergency network level-by-level.

**DFS:** Performs deep connectivity validation.

**Dynamic memory:** The C graph allocates nodes, matrix rows and linked-list edges dynamically and releases them with `free()`.

## Future upgrades

The architecture can later be extended with:

- Real map tiles / Leaflet
- GPS coordinates
- Live traffic APIs
- One-way roads
- Road closures
- Ambulance priority routing
- Traffic-signal timing
- Database persistence
- Native C HTTP service
- A* search
- Priority queue / binary heap Dijkstra
- Authentication and multi-user operation
\n\n## Corrections in this version\n\n- Removed opaque SVG label backing rectangles; map labels now render transparently over the map.\n- Added source/target validation to the browser Dijkstra routine.\n- Zero-initialized the C graph matrix pointer array so partial allocation failures can be cleaned up safely.\n- Added overflow protection to C Dijkstra relaxation and basic CLI route-ID validation.\n\nThe browser UI runs its algorithms in JavaScript; the C engine is independently compiled/tested as documented above. Google sign-in is a demo UI only until a server verifies the returned credential.\n

### Map update
The map uses one consistent eight-node schematic coordinate system across the browser, JSON data, and C engine. The extra Cargo Terminal node has been removed because it made the airport area visually misleading. Airport Junction is placed at the east side of the diagram; roads and route highlighting use the exact same node coordinates. The default Central Square → Airport Junction route is calculated on startup.


### Map alignment note
This is a schematic teaching graph, not a geographic map: coordinates indicate layout only and do not claim real-world airport or bridge locations. Every road endpoint is drawn from the same node coordinates used for its node marker, and the browser, JSON files, and C seed contain the same eight nodes and thirteen roads.
